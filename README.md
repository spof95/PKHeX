![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-GPLv3-blue.svg)

Pokémon core series save editor, programmed in [C#](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_%28programming_language%29).

Supports the following files:
* Save files ("main", \*.sav, \*.dsv, \*.dat, \*.gci)
* Individual Pokémon entity files (.pk\*)
* Mystery Gift files (.pgt, .pcd, .pgf, .wc\*) including conversion to .pk\*
* Importing teams from Decrypted 3DS Battle Videos
* Transferring from one generation to another, converting formats along the way.

Data is displayed in a view which can be edited and saved.
The interface can be translated with resource/external text files so that different languages can be supported.

Pokémon Showdown sets and QR codes can be imported/exported to assist in sharing.

Nintendo 3DS savedata containers use an AES MAC that cannot be emulated without the 3DS's keys, thus a resigning service is required ([svdt](https://github.com/meladroit/svdt), save_manager, [JKSM](https://github.com/J-D-K/JKSM), or SaveDataFiler).

**We do not support or condone cheating at the expense of others. Do not use significantly hacked Pokémon in battle or in trades with those who are unaware hacked Pokémon are in use.**

## Building

PKHeX is a Windows Forms application which requires [.NET Framework v4.6](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48137).

The executable can be built with any compiler that supports C# 6.0.

### Build Configurations

Use the Debug or Release build configurations when building using the .NET Framework.  Use the Mono-Debug or Mono-Release build configurations when building using Mono.

## Dependencies

PKHeX's QR code generation code is taken from [QRCoder](https://github.com/codebude/QRCoder), which is licensed under [the MIT license](https://github.com/codebude/QRCoder/blob/master/LICENSE.txt).

### IDE

PKHeX can be opened with IDEs such as [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/) or [MonoDevelop](http://www.monodevelop.com/) by opening the .sln or .csproj file.

### GNU/Linux

Install [MonoDevelop](http://www.monodevelop.com/) and [Mono Runtime](http://www.mono-project.com/) with `flatpak install --user --from https://download.mono-project.com/repo/monodevelop.flatpakref`. GNU/Linux is not the main Operating System of developers of this program so there may be bugs; some may come from non GNU/Linux specific code of Mono (so developers using \*BSD, Windows and OS X should be able to reproduce them).
